An upgraded Space Invaders game

Description:
My project will be the game Space Invaders but with added features. These will include additional levels, upgrades, monsters, and maybe a shop. It will obviously have the basic mechanics of the game; I just want to play with the other features. It will have a simple graphic design and a home screen.

Prototype:

5/24: I created the Alien, Invaders, and TheGame(main class) classes. As of now, I am using TheGame as a tester, and am working on the other
classes and their methods. I managed to be able to display the image of an alien in the Alien class and initialize a bunch of aliens in the Invaders class.
